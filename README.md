About the project<br />
<br />
FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit that helps people learn by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons. They maintain a resource called DevDocs which helps people collect and search documentation from thousands of software projects. As a team we will select open issues in the DevDocs project (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs) and fix them to improve this project.<br />
